This game is a [FlappyBird](http://www.dotgears.com/apps/app_flappy.html) clone made with [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/). The player score increases by one for each gap passed through the pipes. The game is lost if the player collides with the pipes or the ground.

### Main Topics
* Represent game objects through nodes made from shapes and textures
* Defining the physics simulation associated with the game scene
* Detecting collisions with mask types associated with each node
* Use of timers and arc4random to randomly spawn obstacles

### Future Improvements
* Implement a leaderboard
* Fix the collision bug that happens at first launch if there are no touches
* Improve the method of interacting with the timer when the app goes into the background
